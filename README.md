# Image2ASCII

This is a simple Python script that opens an image that you input and outputs it as ASCII art. It only takes .jpg, .jpeg, and .png. An example image of a monkey's selfie has been provided!

## Directions
Prerequisites: Python, PIL

Download the file, then copy your image into the same directory as the script. Then open Terminal/Command Prompt and run `python3 image2ascii.py <FILENAME>`.
> ex: `python3 image2ascii.py <Capture-2024-07-08-224516.png>`
The resulting image will then be outputted for you to copy and paste!

In the script, there is a variable `targetWidth`. This has been set to a default value of `80`, but can be changed to change how the ASCII art looks.
